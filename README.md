Hello! This is my first html project. A recipe website.

For the first three recipes- lasagna, chicken meal and short ribs, I took images and text from a recipe website. The images are absolute links.

I added another page for the fun of it. My own chocolate chip cookie recipe. I wanted to challenge myself to add my own photos with relative links. I enjoyed writing out the recipe from my own head.

I ran into various problems. 

At one point I couldn't remember the correct way to use the mv command to move a file. I kept renaming it instead. Eventually I looked up the manual page for mv and figured out that I need to use the backslash and provide the destination path with it.

Another time I couldn't get my image to load into the browser. Everything looked correct, my alt text kept showing, I went over it and over it. Then I realized that the extension on my file was in caps and that matters. As soon as I updated my code to reflect that, the problem was solved. It's because when I downloaded the image from my Google Photos that was just the default name. So I'll have to watch out for things like that and try keeping all my file names lowercase.

I had a problem trying to commit my files with Git. I kept getting an error. Can't remember what it said, but I researched the issue on Google and someone mentioned the same problem They said that using single quotes instead of double quotes around the message solved everything so I tried it. Boom. Fixed!
