        <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>These homemade chewy brownies are this, chewy, fudgy and made completely from scratch. You'll never need to use a box mix again!</p>

            
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 1¼ cups (265g) sugar </li>
                <li> ¼ cup (60ml) water </li>
                <li> 2 ounces (56.5g) unsweetened chocolate, chopped into small pieces </li>
                <li> ¾ cup (100g) all purpose flour</li>
                <li> ⅓ cup (30g) regular not dutch process unsweetened cocoa powder </li>
                <li> ½ cup (45g) semi sweet chocolate chips </li>
                <li> ¼ teaspoon baking powder </li>
                <li> Pinch of salt </li>
                <li> 2 large eggs, lightly beaten </li>
                <li> ½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil</li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Line an 8x8 or 9x9 baking pan with parchment paper or foil and lightly grease with cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a small saucepan combine the sugar, water and unsweetened chocolate. Cook over medium-low heat just until chocolate is melted and smooth. The sugar will not be completely dissolved. Let mixture cool slightly (about 5 min).</li>
                <li>In a large bowl add mix together the flour (spoon flour into measuring cup and level off with the back side of a knife for accurate measurement), cocoa powder (spoon cocoa powder into measuring cup and level off with the back of a knife for accurate measurement), chocolate chips, baking powder and salt. Mix until combined. </li>
                <li>Pour in the oil, eggs, and vanilla. Pour in the melted chocolate and stir just until combined. Don't overmix!! Spread evenly into prepared pan and bake for 30-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out with SOME MOIST CRUMBS. DO NOT OVERBAKE if you want moist and chewy brownies. Cool completely before cutting.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Baker's Notes</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Overbaking will result in drier, crumbly brownies. The toothpick needs to have a few moist crumbs on it. Try to test them 5 minutes before the suggested time.</li>
                    <li>This recipe may be doubled and baked in a 9x13 pan.  You may need to add a few extra minutes to the bake time.  </li>
                </ol>
