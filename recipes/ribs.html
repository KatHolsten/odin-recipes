        <p>Recently the internet went wild for a delicious Mississippi pot roast wherein beef is braised in a slow cooker with butter, pepperoncini, and packets of powdered au jus gravy and ranch dressing. Guessing that the MSG from the latter two ingredients explained all the rage, I decided to mimic the flavors using from-scratch seasonings and boneless short ribs. It came out really well, especially when served over mashed potatoes with a garnish of parsley. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ pounds boneless beef short ribs </li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
            <li>1 large onion, sliced </li>
            <li>⅓ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>For the Seasoning Mix:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon onion powder </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried dill weed </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried rosemary </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>For the Rest:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour </li>
                <li>⅔ cup chicken broth </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce </li>
                <li>6 whole pepperoncini peppers </li>
                <li>¼ cup unsalted butter </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Season short ribs with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Heat oil in a pan over high heat. Add short ribs and sear until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer beef to a baking dish.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-high and add onion and mushrooms to the pan. Season with salt. Saute until mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine kosher salt, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, dill, rosemary, thyme, and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Sprinkle seasoning mixture evenly over the beef.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle flour over the onion and mushrooms. Stir to coat and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir and bring to a boil; remove from heat. Pour mixture over the beef and cover with pepperoncini. Place butter on top. Cover baking dish with foil.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meat is fork-tender and falls apart easily, about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
                <li>Spoon sauce from the bottom of the pan onto the beef to serve. Skim off excess fat as desired.</li>
            </ol>
